Naveen Was Employee #2 At Betaflux And Was A Key Component To Our Early Growth. He Is Super Versatile And Resourceful When It Comes To Solving Real World Software Engineering Problems. If You Have To Assign A Piece Of Task To Him And He Doesn't Instantly Know How To Really Crack It Up, I'd Bet He Is Very Likely To Find A Solution Before You'd Expect. Among Everything Else, His Ability To Learn Fast - What Something Is, Why It Is And How It's Done By The Best Standards + What Are The Bad Ways Of Doing It - Is Probably His Most Rewarding Attribute.
